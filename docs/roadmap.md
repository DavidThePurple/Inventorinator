# Roadmap

## v1.2.0 (planned)

### Printed-part model attachments

- Attach STL files to Printed Part inventory records.
- Generate and cache a lightweight preview thumbnail without blocking the UI.
- Provide an interactive rotate and zoom STL preview on desktop and Android.
- Store attachment metadata and checksums separately from the local SQLite state.

### Optional Nextcloud and WebDAV storage

- Add a generic attachment-storage interface; local files remain the default.
- Offer Nextcloud as a WebDAV preset using a revocable app password.
- Upload and retrieve STL attachments and portable database backups.
- Keep SQLite as local storage and Supabase as Remote Sync; WebDAV does not
  replace inventory synchronization, roles, audit history, or conflict rules.
- Add offline transfer state, checksum verification, retry handling, and clear
  local-only/remote-available indicators before enabling shared attachments.
